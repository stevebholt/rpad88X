I will post general resources for your doctoral studies here over time. Occassionally, this will mean posts that lay out tips on presentations, templates for slides or CVs, or links to data that might be useful in a variety of ways. I will occassionally update this over time and welcome requests or links to any data you find interesting or useful to add to the page.
